  1. Add game_locator_service to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:game_locator_service, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure game_locator_service is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:game_locator_service]]
        end
